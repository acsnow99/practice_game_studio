5/10/19:
Today I created a bottomFUL pit, as opposed to a bottomless pit. It transports the player to a "lower" room when
they collide with it. It also draws them in the same way as bottomless pits, since I linked all the pits
using a parent object. I also had to include a lot of code that I had used for room changes from walking off
the screen before. I finally got the alarms to work together, and now the player will appear in the basement
room whenever they fall into one of the pits with the shadowy effect on it. 

Also tried to create an animation when the player is falling into a pit, so they look smaller when they're
deeper in.
