4/28/19: Found some interesting things within the fade in/out objects: apparently, the objects were changing the 
alpha of the entire game, not the alpha of the rectangles they were drawing. What's more, the rectangles weren't 
even drawing in the view. The reason I thought it was working was because when the alpha changed for the entire 
game, it looked like the background color was covering all the objects. 

To fix this, I put the correct functions to get the view's coordinates in the fade in/out objects, and set the
alpha to 1 at the end of every step event in the same objects. 

In this version, I also finished the camera transitions between rooms(overall game rooms, not the walled rooms
within each room). 


5/1: Happy May Day!

Today I finally figured out the jump mechanic! Although it is very stiff and slow feeling. 
I ditched the old jump code inside the jumping object and replaced it with a system in which
a vertical distance variable would update every step, and that would be added to the player's y value.
Soon I will start creating pits to fall into(Oracle of Ages style). Maybe even some that would drop
the player into a different room?
