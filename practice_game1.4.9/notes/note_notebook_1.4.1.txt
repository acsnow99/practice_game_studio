5/6/19:
Now I can kill myself! I added a failstate, where when the player's health is zero or lower, 
which can manually be set with ctrl, they will spawn at the right point, 
and the camera will move quickly back to where the player is.
Next up is spawn point implementation.

Spawn points work now. They give a little message when they save and keep track of the location
the player was in when they saved. I may change this to spawn in a location slightly off from the player's
save location as to not save immediately after respawning. Also, the spawn point 
sprite actually shows up now, as I remembered that if I include a draw event, 
I need to tell the IDE to draw the sprite as well.

Now that I check the function in other rooms, the spawn point does not work quite well when the player
saves in a different room from the starting room. I do not know the cause at the moment.

The cause was that the player object moves to a preset x and y whenever the room starts and it's not the 
first room. It counted respawns the same way, so I made a bool variable 'ded' to keep track of whether 
the player was ded or just moving rooms.

To make the spawnpoint's messages pop out, I made a 'figurehead' object that is only the sprite, which goes
on the layer below the player. Then, the actual coded object is invisible,
but displays text on the top layer.
